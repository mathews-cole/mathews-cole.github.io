        <div class="AboutMeP">
        <p>I'm 17 years old who is enrolled in college on a Cyber Security course. <br> I have recently got into coding in all sorts of languages like Html, css, <br> javaScript, PhP, Python ect. I also do enjoy gaming, i'm a big gamer <br> who plays a variety of different game's. I have even won money off <br> playing these game's before which is another reason i like to game <br> as i am very competetive! Another hobby of mine is football, i used <br> to play for a team and played for years, i ended up stopping to focus <br> on other stuff like college but still stay in touch every now and then <br> and watch games when i can. I like to focus on goals and exceed my <br> own expectation in the things i enjoy. </p>
